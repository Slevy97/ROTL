        Return of the legends (ROTL) is a fighting simulator for medieval 
soldiers, which also gives the player the possibility to explore a medieval land
in which these battles take place.

        There are three types of soldiers that you can buy from the Store: 
Fighters, Defenders and Warriors. They all have different attributes, 
which make them special in a battle.
	
        You can buy as many as you want from each type, upgrade them to 
any level between 1 and 50 in the Arena and simulate fights between two
soldiers in the Fight section (pressing the fight button).
	
        The simulator lets you stop the fight whenever you decide 
in order to heal the soldiers, repair their armors or even 
upgrade them to a superior level in order to
make the fights more exciting.
	
        Note that you enter the game with a fix amount of money and you have to
spend it carefully, even if it is a big one.
